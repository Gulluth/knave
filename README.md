# KNAVE v1.2.0
**Author**: Rabid Baboon
**Version**: v1.2.0
**Foundry VTT Compatibility**: 0.5.5+
**Translation Support**: None 

KNAVE is a rules toolkit created by Ben Milton for running old school fantasy RPGs without classes. Adding, subtracting and modifying rules is both expected and encouraged. Knave’s features include:

- **High compatibility with OSR games.** If you have a library of OSR bestiaries, adventure and spell books, little or no conversion is needed to use them with Knave.
- **Fast to teach, easy to run.** If you are introducing a group of new players to OSR games, Knave allows them to make characters and understand all the rules in minutes.
- **No classes.** Every PC is a Knave, a tomb-raiding, adventureseeking ne’er-do-well who wields a spell book just as easilyas a blade. This is an ideal system for players who like to switch up their character’s focus from time to time and don’t like being pigeonholed. A PC’s role in the party is determined largely by the equipment they carry.
- **Abilities are king.** All d20 rolls use the six standard abilities. The way that ability scores and bonuses work has also been cleaned up, rationalized, and made consistent with how other systems like armor work.
- **Optional player-facing rolls.** Knave easily accommodates referees who want the players to do all the rolling. Switching between the traditional shared-rolling model and players-only rolling can be done effortlessly on the fly.
- **Copper standard.** Knave assumes that the common unit of currency is the copper penny. All item prices use this denomination and approximate actual medieval prices.
